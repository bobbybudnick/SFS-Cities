# SFS-Cities
Grouping of virtual cities created throughout the years

Choosing a city builder
-----
Cities Skylines is not very interesting to build in - still the scale is in favor here  
Simcity is not very interesting once the city is built

Skylines advantages
-----
Definitive large building area of 17.28km across  
3d view to watch city after it is built  
Much better flooding simulation

Realistic roads
-----
Simcity 2000 has only elevated highways and no freeways  
Use parallel roads as freeways  
Not that big of a problem

The scale between 2000/3000/4
-----
There is some disagreement here  
For sure 2000 and 3000 scale is the same because 2000 maps can be imported into 3000  
For sure Simcity 4 maps are 4km across  
2000/3000 tiles could be 16x16 meters for 4km across or 64x64 meters for 16km across  
64x64 meters is around one acre  
64x64 with 16km scale is pretty interesting and some large cities could be built

New Bern, NC - Simcity 3000 - created in and interpreted as early 2010s
-----
You can see the scale in simcity 3000 is pretty large and arguably larger than 4  
This was done by memory so no exact roads and neighborhoods here  
Unfinished buildings and vegetation

Aggrocrag - Simcity 4 - created in and interpreted as mid 2010s
-----
A mountain city with room for growth at the base  
It was extremely tedious getting the highways to swirl up the mountain  
Was the second creation as the first was created in the mid-late 2000s and lost

New Bern, NC - Cities Skylines - created in and interpreted as summer 2022
-----
Done at nearly exact scale but blocks do not look perfect  
Done with exact roads and neighborhoods but population is larger than reality  
Fully complete with some artistic liberties in terms of bridges and highways

Wilmington, NC summer 2018 Cities Skylines exact no vegetation available upon request
